## Releasing
- Before working on the code run `npm start`. This will tell `grunt` to start `watch`ing the `src/` directory and it'll keep building to the `dist/` directory.
- Once you made your changes you can stop the `npm run start` command (by hitting <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd> for example).
- Run `npm run build` this minifies and copies things over one last time.
- Run `npm run archive` to get the tarball with just the minified files
